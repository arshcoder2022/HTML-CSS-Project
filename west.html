		<h2> West India </h2>
		
		<p> <strong> Western India </strong> comprises three large states, one small state and one small union territory. It is bounded by Pakistan and the Arabian Sea to its west and the Gangetic Plains to its east. This is the most heterogeneous of India's regions, with the states differing dramatically from one another in language, culture and levels of economic development. <strong> Maharashtra </strong> and <strong> Gujarat </strong> are among the most industrialised states of India, while <strong> Rajasthan </strong> and <strong> Goa </strong> are magnets for tourists, though for different reasons. Let's explore! </p>
		
		
		<h2> Amber Fort </h2>
		
		
		<div id="hero4"> </div>
		
			
		<p> <strong> Amer Fort</strong> or <strong> Amber Fort </strong> is a fort located in <strong> Amer, Rajasthan, India. </strong> Amer is a town with an area of 4 square kilometres located 11 kilometres (6.8 miles) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. The town of Amer and the Amber Fort were originally built by Raja Man Singh and later, by Sawai Jai Singh. Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur. </p>
		
		
		<p> Amer Palace is great example of Rajput architecture. Some of its buildings and work have influence of Mughal architecture. Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the <strong> Diwan-e-Aam, </strong> or <strong> "Hall of Public Audience", </strong> the <strong>Diwan-e-Khas, </strong> or <strong>"Hall of Private Audience",</strong> the <strong>Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), </strong> or <strong> Jai Mandir, </strong> and the <strong> Sukh Niwas </strong> where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace.
