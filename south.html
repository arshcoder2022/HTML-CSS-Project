		<h2> South India </h2>
		
		<p> <strong> South India, </strong> also known as <strong> Dakshina Bharata </strong> or <strong> Peninsular India, </strong> consists of the southern part of India encompassing the Indian states of <strong> Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana,</strong> as well as the union territories of <strong> Lakshadweep and Puducherry. </strong> Like a giant wedge plunging into the ocean, South India is the subcontinent's steamy heartland – a lush contrast to the peaks and plains up north. South India is a mystic and magnificent destination that combines bright colors, fascinating cultures, and beautiful landscapes, all largely undiscovered by tourists. <strong> Mysore Palace </strong> is one of the most visited sites in South India. Let's explore! </p>
		
		
		<h2> Mysore Palace </h2>
		
		<div id="hero3"> </div>
			
		<p> <strong> Mysore </strong> is commonly described as the <strong> "City of Palaces.” </strong> <br> <br>
		
		An incredibly breathtaking example of the Indo - Saracenic style of architecture, the Mysore Palace is a magnificent edifice located in Mysore in the state of Karnataka. Also known as the <strong> Amba Vilas Palace,</strong> it is the former palace of the royal family of Mysore and is still their official residence. Mysore Palace was built in 1912 for the 24th Ruler of the Wodeyar Dynasty and is counted as one of the biggest palaces in the country. </p>
		
		<p> The facade of the palace is a harmonious blend of Hindu, Muslim, Rajput and Gothic styles, which imparts it a regal quality. With the Chamundi Hills towards its eastern side, the spectacle of the Mysore Palace is an enchanting sight to behold. Needless to say, it is the second most visited historical monument visited by local and foreign tourists after the Taj Mahal. Presently located inside the Old Fort, Mysore Palace is renowned for its light & sound show and vibrant Dussehra celebrations. </p>
