		<p><strong> "Taj Mahal" </strong> means <strong> "Crown of the Palace" </strong> in Urdu and Persian. <br> <br>
		
		An immense mausoleum of white marble built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage. </p>
		
		<p> The Taj Mahal is considered to be the most significant architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognized architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadows, such as arches and domes, further increasing the aesthetic aspect. The color combination of lush green scape reddish pathway, and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever-changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi-precious stones make it a monument apart. </p>
